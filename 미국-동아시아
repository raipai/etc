미국은 동아시아 평화를 위해 무엇을 했나?
가스라-태프트로 밀약으로 한반도를 일본식민지화 하는데 묵인하고
한반도를 강제로 분할하고
한반도 분쟁을 끊임없이 조장하고
북한이 먹고살수 없도록, 자금과 무역단절을 단절하고
체재를 유지하려는 북한은 결과적으로 전제국가가 되고
견딜수 없었던 북한은 결과적으로 핵을 개발하고
미국이 대체 무엇을 잘했다는 것이냐?

What did the United States do for East Asian peace?

US are constantly provoking conflict on the Korean Peninsula,

US has been trying only to use North Korea to secure geopolitical advantage in East Asia.
What on earth did America do well?
....................................................

from 1980, a small group of People, intellectuals, prosessionals have begun to realize
what the United States actually did in East Asia and what their hidden intentions were.

Now, look back before WW2, for a while ago, US allowed Japan to occupy Korea as a colony,
instead US took philipene.  this is so called Taft–Katsura agreement.

After WW2, US troops came in and suddenly divided peninsula into south and north.
In south American pupet regime was burn, and communistic government in north.
