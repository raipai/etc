Graphene's band structure has two distinct bands. These are often known as the K and K' valleys, and they are centered around the K and K' points in reciprocal space. They are very symmetric and also are closely related to a spin-like property of the electrons in the graphene, known as pseudospin. In essence, you can imagine the K valley as being "pseudospin up" and the K' valley as being "pseudospin down". An electron can also be in a superposition of pseudospin up and down, so you can imagine "pseudospin left", "pseudospin right", and so on. The resemblance with spin comes from the fact that scattering processes between the two valleys are fairly rare, and so pseudospin is conserved over some distance. Also, it means that besides the normal factor of 2 degeneracy from real spin, the electrons in graphene have a further factor of 2 degeneracy from the valleys / spin. On the other hand, pseudospin is not associated with a magnetic moment, unlike real spin.
