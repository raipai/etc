1) 1.5 ton of medium size car hit back of small car of 800Kg at rest and and 
slipped after getting stuck together. If the velocity of medium size car was 50 
km/s before collision, then what is their slipping velocity?


2A) prove the formula g = GM/R^2
2B) Using the known radius of the Earth and that g=9.80 m/s^2 at the Earth’s 
surface, find the average density of the Earth.


3) Derive basic formula for Rocket velocity and explain it

4) U(x,t) = 50 sin(300 x – 60 t) is a one dimensional wave equation
Find the amplitude, wave length, frequency wave number, and angular frequency as 
well as wave velocity of this wave.  remember all numbers are in mks unit. 

5) Explain the two fundamental law of thermodynamics including internal energy 
and entropy
